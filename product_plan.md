# Habitmon Product Plan #

## Purpose ##
A habit-tracking app for iOS that allows users to raise "Habitmon", monsters that grow and evolve as the user successfully continues their daily habit.

## Market Research ##

Other gamifying habit-tracking apps:

  - __Habitica__ (used to suck, but listened to user feedback and is now a 5-star app, the most popular gamifying habit-tracking app on the app store)

    * My own thoughts: Too overly complicated; I never feel motivated to deal with any sort of "learning curve" in the short-attention-span that I have when I use a smartphone. I've tried this app multiple times and I just never feel like dedicating any time to figuring it out, but I'm a fan of really simple apps. The difference between habits and dailies and to-do's is unclear, so the 3 separate menus feel like clutter. Avatar customization felt clunky, too many clicks, against my intuition of how I assumed the app would work. Menus felt organized in a completely random way. With mobile apps I like understanding exactly what I'm doing immediately. And why is it constantly loading? Should work offline.

    * Criticisms from other users:
      - "interface items take up way too much vertical space, preventing seeing more than 2 tasks a time."
      - "drop-down notifications in the app very slow and obtrusive, combined with network lagginess"
      - "have to stick with the game til level 15 before I can have fun! a good game design should hook from the get-go"
      - "TEST YOUR APP GODDAMMIT"
      - "could use better explanations of habits vs dailies vs to-dos"

  - __Plant Nanny__ (water-drinking habit only)

    * My own thoughts: Other than the tutorial white font being terribly hard to see on a nearly-white background, I like this app and its simple design. I like the achievements you get to keep you motivated for watering the plant all those days before their "evolution" (inspired the Ribbons in my project!). I like the way you have to hold down on the water instead of just tapping it, giving you a slight feeling of bonding with the plant creature as you feed it. Also, since drinking water is so easy, I find myself getting instantly motivated to go drink some whenever I see the app. Animated plant creature is very cute and appealing, feels alive thanks to animation. Being able to name the plants is a nice touch. But why do you need to "create" cups that stick around forever? Those feel superfluous.

    * Thoughts from other users:
      - "needs more plant choices!"
      -  (positive review:) "each time it levels up I am excited to see what it will look like"
      - "no way to change capacity of drinking cup/bottle once you've set it up, had to delete and start over just to change to more manageable increment, losing all my progress"

  - __Wokamon__ (walking habit only)

    * Haven't tested myself yet. Probably completely obsolete after Pokemon Go...fun art style though.

    * Thoughts from other users:
      - really slow on leveling after the second Wokamon
      - lots of bugs with syncing, losing all data
      - constant nagging to add friends, rate games, Like on FB
      - "no story to discover, wokamons do nothing"

The existing habit-tracking apps all have pretty good reviews already, so I think they're doing well. But there is currently no gamifying habit-tracking app for general habits (as opposed to specific ones) other than Habitica as far as I can see, and I find Habitica to be too complicated to be enthralling (your mileage may vary).

## User Personas ##
Self-improvement-focused millennials with an affection for the kawaii digital pets of their childhood, like Pokemon and Tamagotchi, and who are trying to maintain motivation for the various daily habits they're trying to work on. These users want something simple, cute, and understandable at a glance.
